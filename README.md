This is an example game made using the :fire: [Flame Engine](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame), following the step by step tutorial.

It's a very simple game, where boxes will fall and the goal is to destroy them before they hit the bottom of the screen.

Flame is a minimalist Flutter game engine that provides a few modules to make a Canvas-based game.

To follow the tutorial step-by-step and easily create our own version, check the [article here](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame-example/blob/master/tutorial/article.md).

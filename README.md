This is an example game made using the :fire: [Flame Engine](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame), based of an old step by step tutorial.

It's a very simple game, where boxes will fall and the goal is to destroy them before they hit the bottom of the screen.

Flame is a minimalist Flutter game engine that provides a few modules to make a Canvas-based game.

The master branch of this example is using the bleeding-edge Flame 1.0.0 release candidates. They are not ready for production use; for that use the latest stable Flame 0.27.0.

This tutorial is also available in the following versions: [0.6.x](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame-crates-example/tree/0.6.x), [0.8.x](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame-crates-example/tree/0.8.x), [0.10.x](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame-crates-example/tree/0.10.x) and [0.27.x](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame-crates-example/tree/0.27.x).

You can also try the game yourself via [this APK](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame-example/raw/master/tutorial/flame_example.apk) or [the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.luan.flame.example) (it's just falling boxes and explosions, though).
